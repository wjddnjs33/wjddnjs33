# K-Background

The Ministry of Defense has finally announced the [SLBM](https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/skorea-successfully-tests-submarine-launched-ballistic-missile-blue-house-2021-09-15/)!!!! Such growth in national defense power is very important for independently defending the country LoL

Ah, and a lot of people like to take off their masks when they get vaccinated. Even in places where vaccination rates are high, such as the United States and the United Kingdom, the number of corona patients is almost the same as before vaccination and is still on the rise. Even if the day you take the mask off comes, you are told to put it back on after a few days.

In Korea, as of today (09.17), `21,168,093` mice participated as experimental mice. Also, many people will die from side effects. The sad feelings of those who died... Well, since the corona vaccine came out without a proper clinical trial, it is only natural that there are more side effects than other vaccines.

Oh, and as of 2021, the South Korean regime was eaten by a North Korean spy^^
