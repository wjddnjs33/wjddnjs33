# Introduce

Hi there, My name is Jeongwon Jo(Pocas). I'm a newbie studying about web security/development and english in Seoul, Republic of Korea. And I sometimes do CTF or Bug Hunting. And Recently I am studying development. Web development uses only node.js, flask, django web frameworks to develop back-end.
